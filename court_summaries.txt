**Title: Plastic Surgeon Suspended for One Year Due to Sexual Misconduct and Inadequate Medical Care**

**Summary:** The Central Disciplinary Board for Healthcare in the Netherlands has imposed a one-year suspension on a plastic surgeon for sexual misconduct during a video consultation and providing inadequate medical care. Initially, the Regional Disciplinary Board in Zwolle had ordered the removal of the surgeon from the BIG-register, but this decision was overturned on appeal. The misconduct involved the surgeon displaying inappropriate behavior during a video call, followed by repeated attempts to contact the patient for another consultation. The Central Board deemed the initial penalty of removal too severe, opting instead for the maximum suspension period, considering the incident as isolated with low risk of recurrence. The surgeon is currently receiving psychiatric treatment to address the issues leading to the misconduct.

**Title: Reprimand for Psychiatrist and Clinical Psychologist Upheld for Insufficiently Clear and Consistent Report**

**Summary:** The Central Disciplinary Board for Healthcare has upheld a reprimand against a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist for their inadequate and inconsistent pro Justitia report. Originally, the Regional Disciplinary Board in ’s-Hertogenbosch found in May 2024 that the report did not meet the required standards, leading to the initial reprimand. The professionals appealed, arguing that their conclusions were reasonable based on the facts and findings presented. However, the Central Board agreed with the initial ruling, noting that the report lacked clarity, structure, and logical flow, making it difficult for readers to follow. Despite the complexity of the case, the Board found the reprimand appropriate, though it dismissed other parts of the complaint as unfounded.

**Title: Reduction in Processing Times for Disciplinary Boards**

**Summary:** Over the past year, the Dutch healthcare disciplinary boards have successfully reduced the time taken to resolve complaints. According to the 2024 annual report, the average processing time at the Regional Disciplinary Boards for Healthcare (RTG) decreased from 244 days in 2023 to 205 days in 2024.

Of the complaints handled by the RTG, only a fraction proceeded to a hearing, with most resulting in the lightest sanction, a warning. The report also highlights the dedication of the disciplinary boards to maintain high-quality standards and improve operational efficiency through various initiatives.

**Title: BIG Registration of Internist Revoked Due to Sexual Misconduct with Two Young Patients and a Medical Trainee**

**Summary:** The Regional Disciplinary Tribunal in Amsterdam has revoked the BIG registration of an internist following incidents of sexual misconduct in 2021 involving two young female patients and a female medical trainee. The internist, formerly employed at Maasstad Hospital in Rotterdam, had previously been suspended in 2023 for similar misconduct with three female medical interns. The tribunal found the internist's actions during consultations, which included unnecessary physical examinations, to be inappropriate and damaging. Despite the internist's denial of misconduct and claims of medical necessity, the tribunal deemed the complaints credible and consistent with previous cases. Consequently, the tribunal decided on the severe measure of revocation, citing a breach of trust and harm to the medical profession's integrity.

**Title: Total Professional Ban for Nurse Due to Addiction Issues**

**Summary:** The Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate filed a disciplinary complaint and a proposal to declare a nurse unfit to practice due to addiction issues and inappropriate conduct. The nurse, who worked in a detox unit, engaged in private contact with a client, borrowed money from her, and was found to be addicted to cocaine and cannabis. The disciplinary board found the nurse's actions, including daily drug use, to be unprofessional and a breach of professional boundaries. Consequently, the board ordered the removal of the nurse's registration from the BIG register, prohibited re-registration, and imposed an immediate total professional ban, citing concerns for patient safety and the nurse's refusal to cooperate with a medical examination.

**Title:** Complaint Against Psychiatrist in FFACT Team Regarding Medication Monitoring Unfounded

**Summary:** The Regional Disciplinary Court in Amsterdam has dismissed a complaint against a psychiatrist involved in the care of a patient who died from an overdose/suicide. The patient's parents alleged that the psychiatrist, who was part of the FFACT team and responsible for the patient's medication, failed in prescribing and monitoring Baclofen. The court found that the psychiatrist acted with due care, prescribing Baclofen off-label to manage the patient's severe addiction issues and anxiety, with oversight from the patient's residential care staff. The psychiatrist maintained regular contact with the patient and collaborated with the FFACT team and a consulting addiction specialist to ensure appropriate medication management. Despite challenges in the patient's living situation towards the end of his life, the court concluded that the psychiatrist and the FFACT team provided adequate supervision and care.

**Title: Removal from BIG Register of Plastic Surgeon Due to Sexual Misconduct and Inadequate Medical Care**

**Summary:** The Regional Disciplinary Board for Healthcare in Zwolle has removed a plastic surgeon from the BIG register following incidents of sexual misconduct during a video consultation and inadequate medical care provided to a patient. The surgeon conducted an upper eyelid correction, after which the patient expressed concern and contacted him via WhatsApp. During a subsequent video consultation, the patient perceived inappropriate behavior from the surgeon, leading to a police report and a criminal conviction. The court sentenced the surgeon to 120 hours of community service, a five-month suspended prison sentence, and €500 in damages to the patient. The disciplinary board found that the surgeon's actions during the consultation and his overall practice management were unprofessional and unsafe, justifying his removal from the register.

**Title:** Removal of General Practitioner from BIG Register by Regional Disciplinary Board ’s-Hertogenbosch Following Complaint by Relatives About Inadequate Care

**Summary:** The Regional Disciplinary Board in ’s-Hertogenbosch has decided to remove a general practitioner from the BIG register after a complaint from the relatives of a deceased patient regarding the quality of care provided in the patient's final phase of life. The relatives alleged that the GP failed to refer the patient to a urologist or cardiologist despite significant symptoms, and did not adequately explain the prescribed pain medication. The GP did not respond to the substantive complaints, citing patient confidentiality, and the board found most complaints justified based on the medical records. Noting a pattern from previous disciplinary actions, the board concluded that the GP lacked self-awareness and learning capacity, necessitating the removal from the register and an immediate suspension pending appeal.

**Title: Removal from BIG Register of General Practitioner Due to Sexual Misconduct**

**Summary:** A general practitioner faced allegations of sexual misconduct and practicing during a suspension period. The Regional Disciplinary Board initially dismissed both complaints due to insufficient evidence. However, upon appeal, the Central Disciplinary Board found the sexual misconduct allegations credible, supported by consistent and reliable testimony from the complainant and corroborative evidence from a related court ruling. Consequently, the Central Disciplinary Board ordered the removal of the physician's registration from the BIG register, citing a high risk of recurrence and a lack of self-reflection by the practitioner. The complaint regarding practicing during suspension was not upheld.
